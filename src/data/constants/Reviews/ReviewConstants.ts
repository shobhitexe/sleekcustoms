    description: `We had Sleek Customs do a 5yr ceramic coat to our new car. From start to finish, the process was easy and Patryk made sure to keep us informed before, during and after the work. The car looks more new now, than when we collected it from the dealer, it is spotless and the coating really seems to enhance the satin/matte paint finish. In addition Patryk is happy to offer advice for keeping the coatings at their best. I would highly recommend Sleek Customs for any car detailing work, good value with fantastic service throughout with amazing results!`,

      "Sleek Customs made my vehicle as sleek as when I picked it up from the dealership in 2011. This Camaro was recently imported from Saudi and had a few dings, dangs, chips and scratch‚Äôs as expected with a 12 year old car. That being said, within the short time of a weekend they‚Äôve all been touched up and corrected, the paint swirls are completely gone, a sandblasted front bumper that was dull is now shining like the rest of the car and all thanks to SLEEK CUSTOMS.Patryk and Agata run this family business and take a lot of pride in their work and this is reflected in my car and every other car i have seen their, they treat it as they are their own. The service is warm and friendly from the start to the finish and in the aftercare, you want proof take a look at the photos below, then contact them now for a great deal and an impeccable result on your vehicle (motorbikes included).",
